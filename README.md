# YLD Javascript style guide

```javascript
var thisIsJavascript = "Identifiers should be camelCase. Avoid the_snake_case";
var beConsistentFfs = "TitleCase Acronyms, don't do a XMLHttpRequest";

var oneVarPerLine = "it keeps git history clean, and that's important";

var Yld = {
  // needlessly quoted keys BAD
  type: "company",
  // trailing commas are GOOD: less git noise when adding/rearranging keys.
  //  has no legacy issues we write node so it
  location: "everywhere!", 
// semi-colons GOOD. You know how to omit them, but people maintaining your code might not :)
};
```

## Functions

Function declarations GOOD, better than `var foo = func...` as they enable you to order your code from the highest level (big picture) to lowest level (tiny boring helpers) for more readable code. And they have proper names for stack traces, yay!

```javascript
demonstrateFunctions("Isn't it great that I can call this above the declaration in the same scope?");

function demonstrateFunctions(msg) {
  console.log(msg);
}
```

## Comparisons

```javascript
var x = null;

// this is the only good use for `==`, avoiding the ugly `x === undefined || x === null`
var notNullOrUndefined = x == null; 

if(x === 0) {
  // otherwise stick to triple equals, and everyone will know what you're trying to do!
}
```

## Control flow

```javascript
function returnEarlyIfPossible() {
  // suggest people always use braces with control-flow.
  // Noisy but explicit.
  if(x) {
    return true;
  }
}

// BAD please never ever use logical operators for control flow
x && x.explode();
```

## Object-orientation

Use OO when you have things with state and a large API. As far as possible KISS - functions and data are very predicatable and flat, object hierarchies are not.

```javascript
// PascalCaseConstructors
function YlderAgent(name) {
  this.name = name;
  
  // private fields / methods are prefixed with `_`. 
  // we use them to tell people they're internal implementation details
  // and are subject to API change without warning
  this._lessons = 0; 
}

// use prototypes for cases where you'll be making lots of instances
// to avoid waste. if it's not used loads, feel free to use another pattern (just keep it readable).
YlderAgent.prototype = {
  ranTraining: function() {
    this._lessons += 1;
  },
  // yes, v8 is ES5 so feel free to use getters/setters (where appropriate, don't surprise ppl!)
  get lessons() {
    return this._lessons;
  },
}
YlderAgent.prototype.constructor = YlderAgent;

var sarah = new YlderAgent("sarah");
sarah.ranTraining();
sarah.ranTraining();
```

## Callbacks

Keep work and orchestration separate. Test work separately.

If things get really complex, use `async`.

```javascript
// call the error argument 'err'
fs.readFile("/srv/foo", function(err, data) {
  // keep the work outside of your orchestration code,
  // now we can test `parseFile` easily and synchronously
  var parsed = parseFile(data);
});
```

## Modules

- export only what you need, as documentation for a public API
- if something is only exported for testing purposes, use the `_` prefix: `exports._x = x`
